Game Center Match Plugin
========================

This plugin makes possible to play real time matches using Game Center

Two years ago I created the Game Center Online plugin (https://github.com/jcesarmobile/GameCenterOnlinePlugin) because I wanted to add online game to my phonegap game, Othello Classic (http://goo.gl/hCJjC) 
If you want to see the plugin in action or want to support the game and/or the plugin please download the game.

Some days ago I started updating that plugin because it was very limited and was built to fit my needs, but it was very hard to use in other games other than board games. Furthermore, cordova and Game Center changed a lot in this 2 years too, the first version was built for iOS 6 and cordova 2, so there were a lot of changes to be made, so in the end, I've created this new plugin installable with the cordova CLI

Why? Because with this plugin you can add real time online game without a server, so it has 0 cost to you and no server programming involved.
